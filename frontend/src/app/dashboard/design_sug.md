1. Too many primary colors

You’re using:

Blue (Study Notes)

Green (PYQ)

Purple → Pink gradient (Video)

Orange (Streak / PRO)

Yellow highlights

Neutral gray cards

👉 This creates visual noise and breaks brand identity.

A student platform should feel:

Calm

Focused

Trustworthy
Not like a marketing landing page.

2. No clear brand color hierarchy

Right now:

Blue = primary?

Green = also primary?

Purple gradient = also important?

The user’s eyes don’t know where to look first.

3. Gradient overuse

The purple–pink gradient card looks attractive alone, but:

It doesn’t match the rest

It steals attention from exams (which should be the hero)

What is actually GOOD (don’t change these)

✅ Layout & spacing – very good
✅ Card design & shadows – modern and clean
✅ Icons & typography – professional
✅ Sidebar structure – perfect for an EdTech app

So this is 90% done already. Only color system needs fixing.

Recommended Color Strategy (DCETHelper)
🎯 Use ONE primary color + ONE accent

Since DCETHelper is exam-focused, blue is the best choice.

How to fix your current screen (step-by-step)
1️⃣ Make all main cards same color family

Instead of Blue / Green / Purple:

✅ Use blue shades only
Example:

Study Notes → Blue

PYQ → Slightly darker blue

Video → Blue with subtle gradient (blue → indigo)

❌ Remove pink/purple gradient completely

2️⃣ Use Green ONLY for performance

Green should mean:

Improvement

Success

Correct answers

So keep green for:

↑ 12%

100% Top Score

Progress graphs

3️⃣ PRO & Streak = Orange only

This is good already 👍
Just make it consistent:

Same orange everywhere

No yellow + orange mix

4️⃣ Reduce saturation

Your colors are a bit too strong.

Instead of:

Bright blue → use softer blue

Neon green → use muted green

This reduces eye fatigue for long study sessions.

If you want a “top coaching app” feel

Think of apps like:

Unacademy

PhysicsWallah

Coursera

They all:

Use 1 dominant color

Keep everything else neutral

Let content shine, not colors
